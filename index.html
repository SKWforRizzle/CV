        <p><em>High School Teacher, Future Mom, <strong>Web Development Student</strong></em></p>
        <p>
          I am a Social Studies Teacher at First Coast High School. I enjoyed learning about history as a hobby and I've learned that hobbies should stay hobbies to maintain enjoyment, and to continue enjoying history I will need to pursue a career
          change.
          Now, here I
          am, as a Web Development Student, trying to build on the computer.
